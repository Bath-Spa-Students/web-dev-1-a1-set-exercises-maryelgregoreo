        <p> "Another GOOD Batman Animated Epic!!!" <br> - zardoz-13 </p>

        <p> "What an excellent movie with topnotch writing. Batman: Under the Red Hood delivers on a - dare I say - perfect balance between character and action, 
              not one unneccessary movement, line or direction, a great almost constant flow. Everything has a purpose, and boy does it have a purpose. You know a 
              story is strong when the villain makes you truly question the moral codex or the actions of the hero for real, and once again it's just impressive how the 
              Batman stories can continue to hit deep time after time with only little tweaks and some seemingly innocent yet very uncomfortable questions. For its short run time, 
              I just really recommend checking it out and I doubt you'll not at least find it to be well-made and enjoyable. I think it's some of the best I have seen Batman at personally, 
              and I'm very impressed as a huge Batman fan. I also was not prepared for that last line. No worries, no spoilers. But brace yourself for it. It is very effective."  <br>
              "Quick mentions: The score is really energizing and mood-grabbing, and the voice acting is superb from all." <br> - lukas-ingel </p>

        <p> "Stunning! 'Batman: Under the Red Hood' is a Stunning Watch. Its Gripping, Edgy & Absolutely Nail-Biting!" <br>  - namashi_1 </p>

        <p> "Great animation, great action, great fight choreography, great fight creativity, great direction, masterful dialogue, masterful character acting, unbelievable emotional weight. 
              Also lots of great moments to see for any Batman or DC fan. Very emotional and compelling story. Black Mask is hilarious. Ra's was also incredible in this and was deeply affected 
              emotionally by what happened. Try not to cry after the ending scene. This is also one of the best depictions of Batman. Extremely likable while showing his flaws, happier than usual(before Jason's death), 
              more appreciative of help, and deeply emotionally expressive about what happened. Best Batman movie along with The Dark Knight." <br> - shakedatjunk </p>
