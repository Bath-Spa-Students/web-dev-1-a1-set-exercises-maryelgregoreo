<h1> Kare-Kare </h1> 

<!-- Paragraph: Overview of the Dish -->
<p> Kare-Kare is a Filipino stew celebrated for its luscious, peanut-based sauce. 
    This rich dish is crafted by simmering tender oxtail and tripe in a flavorful broth, 
    infused with aromatics and spices. The stew is then elevated with a colorful array of vegetables, 
    including eggplant, banana blossom, and string beans, adding layers of texture and taste. Accompanied by 
    a side of pungent shrimp paste, Kare-Kare offers a delightful balance of savory and umami flavors. 
    Best enjoyed with steamed rice, this iconic dish encapsulates the heart and soul of Filipino cuisine, 
    providing a comforting and satisfying culinary experience. </p>
